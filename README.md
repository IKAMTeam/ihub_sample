# ihub_sample
Sample project to demonstrate basic concepts. It can be used as a template for new projects.

Sample Integration consists of two python files, **start.py** and **sample.py**.
**sample.py** contains a main business logic. **start.py** is an executable python script, 
which acts as a wrapper to read/validate configuration, install dependencies, and launch **sample.py**. 

The integration adds logs every 5 seconds.
